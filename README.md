# FireTvApp

This is just a simple app to learn MVVMCross, xamarin android native and how to create an app that will be able to run on the amazon fireTv based devices.
Feel free to look around but please be aware that it is extremely simple and is based on the mvvmcross tip calc app from the mvvmcross site.
This is going to be an ever evolving project for me to learn with.
